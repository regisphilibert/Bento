# üç± Bento--webpack

This is a boilerplate for fast tracking an integration prototype or any light static website. 
It runs its tasks with Wepback.

+ Bento is a lunch box made with care. In it you'll find some jade, some sass but no rice. Together they form a healthy stagic website boilerplate built with Webpack.
+ Bento is an [ever name changing](https://github.com/regisphilibert/phil/commit/6bb444a41dcdd0816c85ccf53b2f5ebab1f73fd3) boilerplate for creating one time static html content to be delivered for Backend integration.
+ The goal is to build up your js and styling src tools so you can keep using them in the final environement after BE integration.
+ It uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) for style
+ It uses [Pug](https://pugjs.org) for HTML
+ It's bundled with [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) for dummy data.
+ It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for building the whole thing.
