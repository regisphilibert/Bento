			li Bento is a lunch box made with care. In it you'll find some jade, some sass but no rice. Together they form a healthy stagic website boilerplate built with Webpack.

			li The goal is to build up your js and styling src tools so you can keep using them in the final environement after BE integration.

			li It uses #[a(href="https://pugjs.org") Pug] for HTML
			li It's bundled with #[a(href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/") Faker.js] for dummy data.
